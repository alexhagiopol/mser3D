This repository stores the MSER-related work for the BORG lab. It contains a still image and video generating programs that perform Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) detection and 2D MSER tracking. 

MSER data association is implemented according to Alex's algorithm in MATLAB. 3D projection is implemented using optimization in GTSAM. Virtual measurements are taken using OpenGL and OpenCV.
